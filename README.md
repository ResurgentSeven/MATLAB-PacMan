# MATLAB-PacMan
A very simple script for one level of Pac Man playable on matlab

To play the game you must put all files in your current folder in MatLab. You then open the PacMan_Start.m file and click Run.

You might see the console updating in the background but it will not affect gameplay and is pretty much meaningless. (I'm sure it means something but I'm not bothered by it)

The controls are simple: WASD keys to move and Space to start and stop the game. 

If you stop you will have to click Run again to restart.

Thanks for playing my simple class project. I appreciate ya!
